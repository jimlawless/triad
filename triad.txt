rem This is Triad.  

com ! 
  Triad is an esoteric programming language based on three-letter 
  words as identifiers.  The runtime will consist of built-int procedures,
  user-defined procedures, integer variables, and string variables.

  Once a built-in proc takes over execution of a sequence of characters, 
  that proc will institute its own syntax rules.
